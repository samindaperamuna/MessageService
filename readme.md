## Message Service ##
### Demonstration of multithreaded messaging task scheduler ###

This project consists of a simple socket based server and client which is used to demonstrate customizable track based message service. 

#### Usage ####

Start the demo application by running the instance of `ServiceTestImpl` once. Start a number of clients as separate JVM processes as required. Provide a name, as requested on the client terminal, which is used to identify the user throughout the lifecycle of the tracks.

#### Track Customization ####

Tracks and steps can be customized as needed as the implementation allows. Please refer to the test implementation for more information.
